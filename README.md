# KeyStoneCLI

KeyStoneCLI is a robust command-line utility designed to provide developers with a secure, local vault for sensitive credentials. It allows users to encrypt, store, retrieve, and manage API keys, passwords, tokens, and other confidential data directly from their terminal. Leveraging strong cryptographic techniques, KeyStoneCLI ensures that all secrets are securely stored on the local filesystem, protected by a master password. The tool aims to streamline development workflows by offering quick, secure access to necessary credentials while emphasizing local control and data privacy, eliminating the need to embed sensitive information directly in code or rely on insecure plain-text files.

## Usage

To use KeyStoneCLI, you'll typically interact with it via the command line. Here are some basic operations:

### Initialize Vault

Before storing any credentials, you need to initialize your vault and set a master password. This will create a new vault file and a key file on your local system.

```python
# Example (replace with actual CLI command once implemented)
# from src.keystonecli.main import KeyStoneCLI
# cli = KeyStoneCLI()
# cli.initialize_vault("your_master_password")
```

### Store Credentials

Securely store a new credential (e.g., an API key or password) in your vault.

```python
# Example (replace with actual CLI command once implemented)
# cli.store_credentials("my_api_key", "sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx")
```

### Retrieve Credentials

Retrieve a stored credential using its name.

```python
# Example (replace with actual CLI command once implemented)
# retrieved_key = cli.retrieve_credentials("my_api_key")
# print(f"Retrieved API Key: {retrieved_key}")
```

### List Stored Secrets

View a list of all credential names currently stored in your vault.

```python
# Example (replace with actual CLI command once implemented)
# cli.list_secrets()
```
